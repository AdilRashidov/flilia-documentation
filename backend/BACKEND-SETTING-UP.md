## <a name="setup"></a> Development Setup (Windows)
<strong>NOTE</strong>: Remember that each project repository may have its own specific setup instruction, which are written into the `README.md` file.

#### Prerequisites
- Install [GIT][git]
- Install [ .NET Core 3.1][dotnet31]
- Install [Docker Desktop][dockerwindows]

#### Setting up a project
1. Install the [TYE][tye] globally:
    ```shell
    dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.Tye --version "0.6.0-alpha.21070.5"
    ```
2. Create a folder for Flilia project:
    ```shell
    mkdir "C:\Users\[USER_NAME]\source\flilia\backend"
    cd "C:\Users\[USER_NAME]\source\flilia\backend"
    ```
3. Download files below into the folder you just created `\flilia\backend\...`:
    - <a download="docker-compose.yaml" href="docker-compose.yaml">docker-compose.yaml</a>
    - <a download="pull-all-changes.ps1" href="pull-all-changes.ps1">pull-all-changes.ps1</a>
    - <a download="tye.yaml" href="tye.yaml">tye.yaml</a>
4. Clone the desired repositories into the folder you just created `\flilia\backend\...` (see list of available backend apps above):
    ```shell
    | NOTE: Make sure that you have all necessary rights to access and work with repositories

    git clone [PROJECT_NAME]
    ```
5. Install all dependencies. This command will download all infrastructure services ([Postgres][postgres], [PgAdmin][pgadmin], [Seq][seq], [Elasticsearch][elastic] and [Redis][redis] images) and setup it via docker:
    ```shell
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

#### Set up your development environment
For the explore the code and debug the application we recommend you install one of the IDEs below:
- [Visual Studio][vs]
    ```
    | Note: you have to install at least VS 2019 (16.8 or later).

    Upon running the installer, select the following workloads depending on the apps you intend to test or work with:
    - .NET cross-platform development
    - Azure development (Optional) - It is optional but recommended in case you want to deploy to Docker hosts in Azure or use any other infrastructure in Azure.

    It is also recommended to install extensions below for VS:
    - ReSharper
    ```
- [Visual Studio Code][vscode]
    ```
    It is also recommended to install extensions below for VS Code:
    - C# (id: ms-dotnettools.csharp)
    - Docker (id: ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)
    ```

#### Summary
- You should be able to browse different API services by using the below URLs:
    ```shell
    Service Account: "http://localhost:5000"
    Service User: "http://localhost:5017"
    Service Profile: "http://localhost:5010"
    Service Post: "http://localhost:5011"
    Service Shared: "http://localhost:5015"
    Service Storage: "http://localhost:5013"
    Service Network: "http://localhost:5018"
    Service Notification: "http://localhost:5025"
    Service Business: "http://localhost:5021"
    ```
- You can pull latest changes for all cloned repositories via following command:
    ```shell
    pull-all-changes.ps1
    ```
- You can run all backend applications together with `tye` command line:
    ```shell
    tye run
    ```
    After success running, tye will do two things: start the backend applications and run a dashboard. Navigate to http://localhost:8000 to see the dashboard running.
    \
    The dashboard should show the backend applications running.
    - The `Logs` column has a link to view the streaming logs for the service.
    - the `Bindings` column has links to the listening URLs of the service.

    \
    Navigate to the backend service using one of the urls on the dashboard in the Bindings column. It should be in the form of `http://localhost:[port]` or `https://localhost:[port]`.
    ######
- Once all dependencies is installed, you should be able to browse different infrastructure services by using the below URLs:
    ```shell
    PGADMIN: "http://localhost:5050"
        | NOTE: use following credentials to get access:
            PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: "pgadmin4@pgadmin.org"
            PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: "Qwerty!23"

    Postgres: "http://localhost:5432"
        | NOTE: use following credentials to get access:
            POSTGRES_USER: "postgres"
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "Qwerty!23"

    Seq: "http://localhost:5341"
    Elasticsearch: "http://localhost:9200"
    Redis: "http://localhost:6379"
    ```

Looking for an opinionated guide to C# syntax and conventions? Step right in! This style guide presents preferred conventions.
- [C# Coding Conventions][ccodingconventions]
- [C# documentation][cdocumentation]

You can find the related reference Guide/eBook focusing on architecting and developing containerized and microservice based .NET Applications (download link available below) which explains in detail how to develop this kind of architectural style (microservices, Docker containers, Domain-Driven Design for certain microservices) plus other simpler architectural styles, like monolithic apps that can also live as Docker containers.

There are also additional eBooks focusing on Containers/Docker lifecycle (DevOps, CI/CD, etc.) with Microsoft Tools, already published. You can download them and start reviewing these Guides/eBooks here:
- [Architecting & Developing][microservicesebook]
- [Containers Lifecycle & CI/CD][dockerlifecycleebook]

This guides will help you get started with installing and setting up the languages and tools you need to develop on Windows or Windows Subsystem for Linux:
