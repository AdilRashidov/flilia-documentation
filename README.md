- [Setting up a projects for backend][backend-setting-up]

## Contributing
Read through our [contributing guidelines][contributing] to learn about our submission process, coding rules and more.

## Got a Question or Problem?
- If your question not related to development, please contact a project manager by email or Teams.
- If your question related to development and project source code, feel free to start discussion and ask any questions in [Developers team][developers-team].
- If your question related to development but not with project source code, we recommend using [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow] to ask support-related questions.
	```
	Stack Overflow is a much better place to ask questions since:
	- there are thousands of people willing to help on Stack Overflow
	- questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question/answer might help someone else
	- Stack Overflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.
	```
- If you would like to chat about the question in real-time, you can reach out via our Flilia team in Microsoft Teams.
